# Note for Modelling

- Assumes constant Transformer density in Canberra(transformer/population)
- Uses the three main charging techniques
  - Uncontrolled: Vehicles charging is at maximum charging and plugged in as soon as they get home
  - Distributed: Each charger decides whether to charge their own EV given the SOC and voltage 
  - Equal Shares: Splits the remaining transformer capacity evenly to each vehicle equally
